# Hyero's Unity Essentials
A subrepository for all of my Unity interproject files

## What does it include
- Shuffling list
- Picking random object from list
- Weighted random tables
    - Dynamic weighted random tables, instead of fixed random values you pass a function that calculates it in runtime
- Window manager including modal windows
- Unity Toggle with ability to swap objects rather then toggle on on and off
